This repo contains class exercises, mini-projects, and personal experiments I’ve worked on while learning JavaScript. It’s a reflection of my growth, curiosity, and hands-on learning.

Whether it's:
- Writing clean functions,
- Understanding variables and data types,
- Practicing loops and conditionals, or
- Exploring arrays, objects, and DOM manipulation
- Writing and reusing JavaScript functions
- Handling user inputs and conditional logic
- Manipulating the DOM with JavaScript

You'll find it all here.
